FAQ
---

Q: Will the game have alternate playable characters?

A: I would like to add in Duck Hunt the Dalmatian 
and Vista the German Shepherd as alternate skins 
at some point, but at the moment I want to finish 
all the necessities first. 

Q: What inspired you for the subject of the game?

A: I like dogs and the Google dinosaur game, so
I thought it would be fun to make a side scroller
with a canine as the main character! 

Q: Will you ever publish the game online?

A: I would like to convert it to HTML and publish it 
on the net someday! However, converting code to a 
different language is a lot of work so it will be
a while before that happens.

Q: Why is the game called "The Broken Link?"

A: I heard my CCR teacher use the expression 
"Broken Link" one day and thought, "Hey, that's 
pretty good." It doesn't necessarily have anything
to do with the game.
